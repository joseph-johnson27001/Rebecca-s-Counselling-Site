# Rebecca Raye — Counselling Site (Vue 3 + Vite)

This is a minimal Vue 3 scaffold for the Rebecca Raye counselling website. It includes a simple layout, router, components and placeholder images.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Notes

- Replace the placeholder images in `src/views` and `src/assets` with your own photos and the real logo.
- No CSS frameworks (Vuetify/Tailwind) are used — simple custom CSS is in `src/assets/styles.css`.
- If you'd like, I can add a deploy config, contact form backend, or swap placeholder images for provided assets.
